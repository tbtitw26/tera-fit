                    answer: `${COMPANY_NAME} is an online platform where you can order personalized training programs. You choose between a specialist-made program (primary service) or a faster AI-generated plan, and receive your workout as a structured PDF.`,

                    question: "How does the process work?",
                    answer:
                        "You create an account, buy tokens, fill out a short form about your goals and level, and choose who builds your program — a certified specialist or AI. Once ready, your plan is delivered as a downloadable PDF.",

                    question: "What are tokens?",
                    answer:
                        "Tokens are the internal currency of the platform. You use them to order specialist-made programs or generate AI workout plans. 1 euro equals 100 tokens.",

                {
                    question: "What’s the difference between a specialist and AI program?",
                    answer:
                        "Specialist programs are manually created by certified coaches and include deeper personalization, adjustments for injuries, and detailed progression. AI programs are generated faster and are ideal when you need a quick, structured plan.",

                    question: "Which option should I choose?",
                    answer:
                        "If you want maximum quality and detailed personalization, choose a specialist. If you need a plan quickly and prefer a faster solution, AI is a good alternative.",

                    question: "How long does it take to receive my program?",
                    answer:
                        "AI programs are generated shortly after submission. Specialist programs take longer because they are built manually to ensure higher quality and accuracy.",

                    question: "What do I receive after ordering?",

                    question: "Can the program be adapted for injuries or limitations?",
                    answer:
                        "Yes. You can specify injuries, limitations, or equipment constraints in the form. Specialists adjust the plan manually, and AI also accounts for basic restrictions.",
                },
